# Brigade SDK for JavaScript Browser-Based Example

This example utilizes a "kitchen sink" approach to demonstrate use of Brigade 2
APIs via this SDK.

It will log in to the Brigade 2 API server as the root user and create a service
account that will be used by all subsequent steps. If root access is disabled on
your API server, the example can be modified (an exercise for the user) to use
the token for an established service account.

__Note: The example will create garbage in your API server and will _not_ clean
it up. It is not recommended to run this against a shared / production API
server.__

Running this example requires:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A modern web browser
* A running (local or remote) Brigade 2 API server, with root access enabled
* The Brigade 2 API server root password

Open the file `src/index.ts`, modify the values of the following constants at
the top of the file and save:

```typescript
const apiAddress = "<Brigade 2 API server address>"
const rootPassword = "<Brigade 2 API server root password>"
```

To obtain all required dependencies, transpile the example TypeScript, and run
the example in your system's default browser, all in one shot, navigate to this
directory, then:

```shell
$ yarn demo
```
